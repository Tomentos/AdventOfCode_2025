# Advent of Code 2025 Write Up

These are my solutions for the 2025 Advent of Code event. I haven't really coded in almost 2 years due to the forced cloud-ification of the industry forcing me to do disgusting things like *learn PowerFX and Power Automate*. I'm doing this to see if I can still retain and maybe increase some of my skills here.

The solutions are often disgusting. Since there's only 12 days worth of challanges this year, I will probably go back and clean up some solutions of mine.

## TechJoyce Event

I already have en entire Repo dedicated to my contributions to the TechJoyce Discord server. That includes tutorials for learning some very basic aspects of the IT world. This year I am responsible for an event challanging the members to compete in a private leaderboard for 1st place.

I did this in an effort to keep the server active a bit, if it ends up being worth it, we'll see.
